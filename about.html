 <h5>Welcome to Sarah Adeline Artistry</h5>

 <div class="container">

 <h6>Ever since I was a little girl, I was facinated with art.  It was always my favorite class at school, as I loved to see and create beauty.  Now, as a photographer, painter, and writer, I get to live this passion everyday.  Sarah Adeline Artistry is a collection of some of my finest work.  If you find that you connect with my work and would like to join with me for a project, please reach out to me.  I would love to hear from you!</h6>
